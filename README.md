# DeViciency
‘DeViciency’ is a vitamin source provider application that provides the user a high source of vitamins within its database. All thirteen vitamins, A to K, are included. It allows several combinations of vitamins that are programmed within the application. The sources given are based upon research. This application aims to help combat vitamin deficiency using common foods that people usually eat. This is to show my animation prowess used in the application. All images are mine, but I do not own Centrum. Only available in Android as it was made in Java within IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio.
